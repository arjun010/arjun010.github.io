			<ul>
				<li>You will be presented with two different data tables and your task is to enter <b>four or more questions/statements</b> you might ask or pose to a data visualization system while exploring a data table.</li>
				<li>For this particular experiment, we encourage you to think of questions that <b>focus on exploring relationships between items of the data tables</b>. In other words, questions that can be answered if you were provided with a graph (network diagram) connecting different items or entities.</li>
				<li>Please note that the goal here is not to write a SQL query so please feel free to <b>phrase your questions as naturally as you wish to</b>.</li>
